Analyze the conversation and structure your feedback like this:

1. Builder DNA ðŸš€
- What have they actually shipped?
- How quickly do they move from idea to execution?
- Examples of persistence and problem-solving

2. Areas to Level Up ðŸ’ª
- What could make their builder journey stronger?
- Any gaps between talking and doing?
- Specific points where they could show more execution

3. Next Steps ðŸŽ¯
Clear verdict: Ready for Agentics.casa or needs more shipping?
- If ready: What made you believe in their builder mindset?
- If not yet: Specific, actionable steps to level up their builder game

Keep it real and energetic, but focus on growth potential. Use examples from their pitch to back up your points.`
